The network described in the omnet.ini file is configured from http://g.sfaye.com/

This example shows how to simulate wireless sensor networks.
Three different routing protocols are considered, for
different traffic types:
convergecast, with Wiseroute.
network-level broadcast, with flooding and probabilistic broadcast.
